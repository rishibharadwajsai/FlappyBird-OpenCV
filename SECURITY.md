## Security Policy

We take the security and privacy of our users very seriously. Here are the key points of our security policy:

1. **Data Privacy**: This game uses a webcam to capture facial data for controlling the game. We do not store or transmit any personal data beyond what is necessary for game functionality.

2. **Security Measures**: All data captured by the webcam is processed locally on your machine. We do not share or send this data to external servers.

3. **User Control**: You can stop the game at any time, which will stop all data capture and processing.

4. **Vulnerabilities**: If you identify any security vulnerabilities or issues, please report them to us so we can address them promptly.

5. **Third-Party Libraries**: We use third-party libraries (Pygame, OpenCV, MediaPipe) which have their own security practices. Ensure that these libraries are up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.

If you have any concerns or need more information regarding our security practices, please contact us at:
